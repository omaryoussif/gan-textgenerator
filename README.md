This is a project where I experimented through developing a GAN-based text generator to learn more about GANs and also Deep Learning/Machine Learning as a whole. The dataset used for this project is from UCSD and is a set of question and answer pairs from Amazon products. I used 1.4M pairs for this project, but can't upload it to GitHub due to file size restrictions.

You can access the data from this link: https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/qa/

The data should be stored in a folder named "data" and the code will generate a folder named "clean" which has wrangled and organized data for the data pipeline and GAN generator.
